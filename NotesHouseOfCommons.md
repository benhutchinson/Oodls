####The 2015 House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee Report
======================================================================================

Here are some extract notes from the [Food security: demand, consumption and waste](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmenvfru/703/703.pdf) report relevant to our project.  

###My Observations
This is not in the report, but note that Tesco's 2014 Annual Revenue was £43.6bn and at its peak, there was a famous phrase that one in every seven pounds spent in the UK was spent in Tesco.  I think this offers a powerful comparison for the scale of the problem.  £12.5bn of food waste is cited below, equivalent to over 25% of Tesco's annual turnover.  I think the comparison to France, redistributing 20 times the volume of surplus food compared to the UK is also compelling.

###Highlight Extracts From The Report

* According to WRAP (the Waste & Resources Action Programme), 15m tonnes of food are wasted each year, of which nine million tonnes is avoidable.  Half of the UK's food waste (around seven million tonnes) occurs in the home, with the average UK household throwing away the equivalent of six meals every week.  In total, £12.5bn of food bought by consumers is wasted each year.  22% of the edible fresh produce bought by householders is not eaten according to the Fresh Produce Consortium.

* Fareshare estimated that in the UK each year 400,000 tonnes of waste food could have been eaten, yet only 2% is redistributed.  The charity criticised this low level noting that France redistributed 20 times the volume of surplus food redistributed in the UK.

* Key moments of change in people's lives, such as house moves or the departure of teenagers for college, could be opportunities to shift behaviours.  Underpinning WRAP's approach was an overall aim to change culture such that it is not seen as normal to waste food.

* The Government set out its views on waste reduction in its reponse to an April 2014 House of Lords report into food waste prevention and "reiterated a commitment to the waste hierarchy of prevention first, with redistribution for human consumption where possible next."   Ministers have highlighted "WRAP's" contribution to waste reduction achievements such as its work on labelling aimed at discouraging retailers from putting unnecessary date labels on products.

* Food critics touch on issues "such as banning the sale of bagged fruit and vegetables in supermarkets" and the "promotion by supermarkets of multi-buy deals such as 'buy one get one free' offers has been highly criticised," though WRAP noted that "there was no clear evidence" that these "were a key source of household waste."  

* Programmes such as those run by WRAP have driven reductions of 21% in avoidable household food waste since 2007.  

* A key short-term measure that can be taken to help those in emergency need of food is the distribution of food that would otherwise be wasted via charitable foodbanks such as the 420 operated by The Trussell Trust.  The Trussell Trust estimated that nationally some 913,000 people had received foodbank support in 2013-14.  The charity had provided some 350,000 food parcels in 2012-13, doubling its previous year's donations.

* Individuals also contribute via supermarkets and direct to charities food they have bought specifically for redistribution via foodbanks.  Foodbanks distribute to those in need.  Fareshare supplies more than one million meals a month through 1,290 foodbank charities.

* Defra stated that it has prioritised food redistribution in the waste hierarchy ... but a WRAP working group on effective redistribution has been inactive since March 2014.  Defra has stated that it will hold a roundtable meeting to bring together representatives from the food sector to discuss progress, and options for additional action to increase the amount of surplus food which is redistributed for human consumptino.

* Distribution is a barrier for those with surplus food providing it to those in need.  Redistributing food, particularly fresh food, is a logistical challenge.  Donors need an incentive to provide surplus food in the first place and it must be matched with the right recipients quickly while still edible.  Retailers should work with charities such as Plan Zheroes who are playing a growing role finding practical solutions.

* Conclusions: National Approaches are needed to deliver a step-change in the amount of surplus food diverted from all parts of the supply chain to feed those in need.  Defra must lead...."and support the development of effective systems to distribute far greater volumes of food that would otherwise go to waste."  Defra should set up a task force to co-ordinate national work by charities, local authorities, retailers, food producers, and manufacturers to establish an effective food redistribution network across the country.
